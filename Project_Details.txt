Project: Secret Code Breaker
Language: Python
Type: Console-based application

Description:
Secret Code Breaker is a password guessing game where the computer randomly selects a word from three difficulty levels:

Easy: Simple, short words

Moderate: Medium-length words

Hard: Long and tricky words

The user selects the difficulty level and tries to guess the secret word.
After each wrong guess, the program generates a hint:

Correct letters in the correct position are displayed.

Incorrect letters are replaced with underscores (_).
The user continues guessing until the correct word is entered.

Key Features:

Multiple difficulty levels

Random word selection

Attempt counter

Dynamic hints for user guidance

Simple and engaging console interaction

Learning Outcomes:

Understanding randomization in Python

Practicing loops, conditions, and string handling

Improving problem-solving and debugging skills

Designing an algorithm for interactive hints

Writing clean and modular Python code

Future Extensions:

Add a scoring system

Implement time-based challenges

Convert to a GUI-based application

Extend word bank for more variety

This project demonstrates skills in Python programming, algorithm design, and interactive application development.
